# DAS Trader Scripts

Shared DAS Trader `.das` scripts and a canonical `keymap.yaml`, maintained for use with the DAS Hotkey Tools VS Code extension.

## Overview

This repository contains human-readable hotkey scripts plus a keymap file that can be compiled into a DAS `Hotkey.htk` file. It exists to make large hotkey libraries easier to review, version, and share than editing Hotkey.htk directly.

## Repository Layout

- `keymap.yaml` - Hotkey metadata and key bindings.
- `hotkeys/` - Primary hotkey scripts.
- `other scripts/` - Supporting scripts or utilities.
- `output.htk` - Compiled output (generated by the build command).

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.107+
- DAS Hotkey Tools extension (from the VS Code Marketplace or .vsix)

## Build Hotkey.htk

1. Open this repo in VS Code.
2. Ensure `keymap.yaml` is present at the repo root.
3. Run `DAS: Build Hotkey File`.
4. Use the generated `output.htk` in DAS Trader.

## Notes

- Scripts are plain text and safe to review in source control.
- The compiler is deterministic: the same inputs produce the same output.
- Use `// Ignore: True` in a script to exclude it from builds.

## Risk Disclaimer

These scripts are provided "as is" and are used at your own risk. Always review and test hotkeys before use in DAS Trader.
