# DAS Trader Scripts

Shared DAS Trader `.das` scripts and a canonical `keymap.yaml`, maintained for use with the DAS Hotkey Tools VS Code extension.

## Overview

This repository contains human-readable hotkey scripts plus a keymap file that can be compiled into a DAS `Hotkey.htk` file. It exists to make large hotkey libraries easier to review, version, and share than editing Hotkey.htk directly.

## Repository Layout

- `keymap.yaml` - Hotkey metadata and key bindings.
- `hotkeys/` - Primary hotkey scripts.
- `other scripts/` - Supporting scripts or utilities.
- `output.htk` - Compiled output (generated by the build command).

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.107+
- DAS Hotkey Tools VS Code extension (https://github.com/madiver/dasVSide)

## Build Hotkey.htk

1. Open this repo in VS Code.
2. Ensure `keymap.yaml` is present at the repo root.
3. Run `DAS: Build Hotkey File`.
4. Use the generated `output.htk` in DAS Trader.

## Notes

- Scripts are plain text and safe to review in source control.
- The compiler is deterministic: the same inputs produce the same output.       
- Use `// Ignore: True` in a script to exclude it from builds.
- Use `// Group: <name>` to tag a script's category (kept in sync with the      
  section headers in `keymap.yaml` for easier organization).

## Script metadata

The DAS Hotkey Tools extension reads simple header tags from each script file.
These live in the first few comment lines of a `.das` file.

Example:

```das
// BUY 10 BID+ SL
// Group: Buy orders: Bid+ SL
// Ignore: True
```

Current groups used in `hotkeys/`:
Buy orders: Ask SL, Buy orders: Ask+ SL, Buy orders: Bid SL, Buy orders: Bid+ SL,
Global controls & config, Sell orders: Ask, Sell orders: Bid-, Session equity &
PnL, Stops, Take profit, Utilities & toggles.

## Risk Disclaimer

These scripts are provided "as is" and are used at your own risk. Always review
and test hotkeys before use in DAS Trader.
- Test changes in SIM and confirm order routes, share sizes, and risk controls.
- Hotkeys can place, modify, or cancel orders instantly; mistakes can be costly.
- You are responsible for compliance with broker rules, account settings, and
  regulatory requirements.
